R1.3.2: scondam
    CATER #147536: Per Ops, change PV KLYS:DMPH:1:FCLCKD alarm state from 
	     MAJOR (red alarm) to MINOR (yellow warning)
		 
R1.3.1: scondam
    Build with asyn R4.32-1.0.0
   
R1.3.0:
	08-Nov-2017: H. Slepicka
	* First version with the Git Workflow.
	* Upgrade to Asyn R4.31-0.1.0
	* Upgrade to R2.2.5

mksu-R1-2-3:
        27-Nov-2017: K. Luchini
         * upgrade from ASYN_MODULE_VERSION=asyn-R4-21_1-0
         * to ASYN_MODULE_VERSION=R4.31-0.1.0
         * upgrade from MISCUTILS_MODULE_VERSION=miscUtils-R2-2-2
         * to MISCUTILS_MODULE_VERSION=miscUtils-R2-2-3

mksu-R1-2-2:
        26-Feb-2014: Mike Zelazny
        * Add/change DESCs and EGUs for API PVs

mksu-R1-2-1:
        24-Feb-2014: Mike Zelazny
        * Add PINIs as per Shantha

mksu-R1-2-0:
        19-Feb-2014: Mike Zelazny
        * Support "info" fields in "maps" files
        * Add autosaveFields info fields to map files
        * Add alarm severities to map files

mksu-R1-0-23:
        19-Oct-2013: Ernesto
        * Build against asyn-R4-21_1-0

mksu-R1-0-22:
	09-Oct-2013: S.Condamoor
	* Status bit KLYS:DMP1:1:FCLCKDL typo fixed
	
mksu-R1-0-21:
	17-Jul-2013: S.Condamoor
	* 
	* Added Fault counters and auto-reset for all fault counter status registers.
	* This is needed since the MKSUII Firmware was upgraded to version 5.30 whcih
	*    automatically clears the faults but latches the fault statuses so they can be read.
	
mksu-R1-0-20:
	24-Jun-2013: S.Condamoor
	* 
	* AutoReset feature added per P.Krejcik's request.
	* Start/End plot record fix for Reverse Power	
	
mksu-R1-0-19:
	05-Jun-2013: S.Condamoor
	* 
	* Several fixes resulting from testing in lab.
	
mksu-R1-0-18:  Building against asyn-R4-20_1-1	

mksu-R1-0-17:
	19-Apr-2012: L.Piccoli
	* Fixed white PVs on several EDM screens (forgot to update those
 	  after firmware changes.

mksu-R1-0-16:
	18-Apr-2012: L.Piccoli
	* Modified MksuComm to return asynError if MKSU is not connected,
	  so PVs become INVALID.
	* Fixed negative signs of -5V, -15V and -24V MKSU readings.

mksu-R1-0-14:
           10-Apr-2012:  Ernesto
           Build against EPICS R3-14-12 and get rid of old style config directory

mksu-R1-0-13:
	* Changes to register based on Qiao's comments

mksu-R1-0-12:
	* Changes to the Klystron Body Temperature conversion
	* Addition of bits/registers.

mksu-R1-0-11:
	* Added panel for Fault Generator (missing the fault
	  counter)

mksu-R1-0-10:
	* Maps for Focus Coil, Magnet, Ion Pump and Fault Generator
	* Panels for Focus Coil, Magnet, Ion Pump. Still missing
	  panels for Fault Generator

	* Command to generate databases:
	 cd mksuApp/src/; ../../tools/generate.py MksuList.map MksuParam

mksu-R1-0-9:
	* Maps for the Waterflow, Modulator and Legacy Modulator
	  added
	* Panels for Waterflow and Modulator added

mksu-R1-0-8:
	* More maps and edm screens added

mksu-R1-0-7:
	* Addition of Fast ADC average waveform maps and
	  panel
	* Fixed addresses for the voltage block (inverted
	  addresses)

mksu-R1-0-6:
	* Addidion of Fast ADC Waveform maps
	* Addition of Fast ADC edl panel: waveform plots
	  display the wrong scale, as if the data is of
	  unsigned shorts.

mksu-R1-0-5:
	* Addition of map file for the Fast ADC control Block.
	  Missing EDM panel for Fast ADC controls.

mksu-R1-0-4:
	* Changed generate.py script to take a file containing
	  list of map file names.
	* Source map files are now organized by FPGA block
	  and reside under mksuApp/src/maps/*.map
	* Added support to convert 16bit value into a signed
	  short int (add "convert 1" to the register entry
	  in the map file). If field is not present no
	  conversion happens. Conversion occurs in the 
	  MksuDriver::readInt32() method (if conversion
	  field is non zero).
	* Added all current PVs to the mksu_main.edl panel

mksu-R1-0-3:
	* Initial edm panels added
	* Added control for individual bits

mksu-R1-0-2:
	* Got Int16Array working (read/write)
	* Bits of status control are read/write via several
	  linked records. A CALC record is used to shift
	  bits left or right to match the actual MKSU masks.
	  This may not be the best way to implement these,
	  but it works.
	* Renamed a few PVs in the MksuRegister.map file
	* Added 'operation record' to the generator.py, now
	  records with that operation are created in the
	  template file, but not in the c++ header file.
	  This allows auxiliary records to be added without
	  having to define another template file.
	* TODO: make the generate.py script check everything
	  that is possible to check!

mksu-R1-0-1:
	* Got Int8Array working
	* PVs defined to read system info (block 0x64 work)x

mksu-R1-0-0: Initial realease - pretty empty!
