mksu-R1-0-10:
	* Maps for Focus Coil, Magnet, Ion Pump and Fault Generator
	* Panels for Focus Coil, Magnet, Ion Pump. Still missing
	  panels for Fault Generator

	* Command to generate databases:
	 cd mksuApp/src/; ../../tools/generate.py MksuList.map MksuParam

mksu-R1-0-9:
	* Maps for the Waterflow, Modulator and Legacy Modulator
	  added
	* Panels for Waterflow and Modulator added

mksu-R1-0-8:
	* More maps and edm screens added

mksu-R1-0-7:
	* Addition of Fast ADC average waveform maps and
	  panel
	* Fixed addresses for the voltage block (inverted
	  addresses)

mksu-R1-0-6:
	* Addidion of Fast ADC Waveform maps
	* Addition of Fast ADC edl panel: waveform plots
	  display the wrong scale, as if the data is of
	  unsigned shorts.

mksu-R1-0-5:
	* Addition of map file for the Fast ADC control Block.
	  Missing EDM panel for Fast ADC controls.

mksu-R1-0-4:
	* Changed generate.py script to take a file containing
	  list of map file names.
	* Source map files are now organized by FPGA block
	  and reside under mksuApp/src/maps/*.map
	* Added support to convert 16bit value into a signed
	  short int (add "convert 1" to the register entry
	  in the map file). If field is not present no
	  conversion happens. Conversion occurs in the 
	  MksuDriver::readInt32() method (if conversion
	  field is non zero).
	* Added all current PVs to the mksu_main.edl panel

mksu-R1-0-3:
	* Initial edm panels added
	* Added control for individual bits

mksu-R1-0-2:
	* Got Int16Array working (read/write)
	* Bits of status control are read/write via several
	  linked records. A CALC record is used to shift
	  bits left or right to match the actual MKSU masks.
	  This may not be the best way to implement these,
	  but it works.
	* Renamed a few PVs in the MksuRegister.map file
	* Added 'operation record' to the generator.py, now
	  records with that operation are created in the
	  template file, but not in the c++ header file.
	  This allows auxiliary records to be added without
	  having to define another template file.
	* TODO: make the generate.py script check everything
	  that is possible to check!

mksu-R1-0-1:
	* Got Int8Array working
	* PVs defined to read system info (block 0x64 work)x

mksu-R1-0-0: Initial realease - pretty empty!
