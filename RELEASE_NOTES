mksu-R1-0-2:
	* Got Int16Array working (read/write)
	* Bits of status control are read/write via several
	  linked records. A CALC record is used to shift
	  bits left or right to match the actual MKSU masks.
	  This may not be the best way to implement these,
	  but it works.
	* Renamed a few PVs in the MksuRegister.map file
	* Added 'operation record' to the generator.py, now
	  records with that operation are created in the
	  template file, but not in the c++ header file.
	  This allows auxiliary records to be added without
	  having to define another template file.
	* TODO: make the generate.py script check everything
	  that is possible to check!

mksu-R1-0-1:
	* Got Int8Array working
	* PVs defined to read system info (block 0x64 work)x

mksu-R1-0-0: Initial realease - pretty empty!
